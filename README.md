Ole Food Reviews Information

-To run the code:
	call make a.out
	Station_Array_Driver.cpp
	ReviewDriver.cpp

-Non implemented but coded files:
	Meal_Array.cpp, Meal_Array.h, Station_Array.cpp, Station_Array.h Station_Array_Driver.cpp
	Review.cpp Review.h ReviewArray.cpp ReviewArray.h ReviewDriver.cpp
	Meal2.txt, Station.txt

-Helpful Notes:
	Given that the current code for Station array, meal and reviews is intertwined, running it will not work. 
	However Tyga is hoping to work on the code over the summer and maybe make it a long time project before leaving St Olaf.
